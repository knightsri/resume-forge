## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Industry Career Management

If you work across multiple industries or have diverse experience:

#### Create Industry-Specific Summaries

```bash
# Process documents by industry focus
mkdir temp_healthcare temp_finance temp_tech

# Move relevant documents to each folder
cp *medical* *healthcare* temp_healthcare/
cp *finance* *banking* temp_finance/
cp *software* *tech* temp_tech/

# Process each industry separately
# Then combine summaries in Phase 5
```

#### Custom Targeting Strategies

Create specialized opportunity templates:

**Healthcare Focus** (`opportunities/template_healthcare.md`):

```markdown
# Company: [Healthcare Organization]
# Role: [Clinical/Administrative Role]
# Regulatory Environment: [FDA, HIPAA, etc.]

## Compliance Requirements:
[Specific regulatory needs]

## Patient Impact Focus:
[How role affects patient outcomes]
```

**Technology Focus** (`opportunities/template_tech.md`):

```markdown
# Company: [Tech Company]
# Role: [Engineering/Product Role]
# Tech Stack: [Required technologies]

## Scale Requirements:
[Users, transactions, data volume]

## Innovation Focus:
[Cutting-edge tech, research areas]
```

### Large Document Collections (100+ Files)

#### Batch Processing Strategy

```markdown 
# Use this approach for 100+ documents:

1. **Phase 1-3**: Process in batches of 25-30 files
   - Move files to batch folders: batch1/, batch2/, etc.
   - Process each batch completely through Phase 4
   - Combine DETAILED_SUMMARY.json files in Phase 5

2. **Consolidation**: Merge multiple summaries
   - Upload all DETAILED_SUMMARY files to Claude
   - Use custom prompt to merge summaries
   - Create master Comprehensive_Resume.json
```

#### Memory Management

```markdown
# For very large collections:

1. **Monitor system resources** during processing
2. **Close other applications** while running extraction
3. **Process overnight** for large batches
4. **Use checkpointing** - save progress frequently
5. **Split decades** - process by time periods
```
