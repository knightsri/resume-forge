# COMPREHENSIVE CAREER DATA CLEANUP & CONSOLIDATION SESSION

I've processed my career document collection (resumes and cover letters) spanning my professional experience using automated extraction with comprehensive data capture. I have attached a DETAILED_SUMMARY.json file containing all organized career data that needs intelligent cleanup and consolidation.

## Background Context:
- **Documents processed**: Large collection of career documents
- **Career span**: Full professional timeline
- **Data approach**: Captured EVERYTHING - erred on side of more information rather than less
- **Current state**: Raw comprehensive data needs intelligent deduplication and organization

## Data Structure Overview:
The attached file contains exhaustively categorized career information including:

- Application patterns and target analysis

- **Education**: Consolidate multiple references to same degrees/institutions

### 2. Data Quality Resolution
- **Date Conflicts**: Resolve inconsistent dates between documents (ask me to clarify when needed)
- **Timeline Gaps**: Identify and help fill employment/education gaps
- **Conflicting Information**: Surface conflicts and guide resolution decisions
- **Missing Context**: Identify where additional context would strengthen the narrative

### 3. Strategic Career Positioning
- **Value Proposition**: Extract and refine core value propositions from cover letter narratives
- **Career Progression**: Analyze and highlight career advancement patterns
- **Skill Evolution**: Track technology skill development over time
- **Achievement Patterns**: Identify recurring themes in accomplishments
- **Leadership Growth**: Document progression in leadership responsibilities

### 4. Content Enhancement & Organization
- **Achievement Optimization**: Ensure all achievements have quantifiable metrics where possible
- **Technology Categorization**: Organize skills by current relevance and proficiency
- **Experience Prioritization**: Help determine which experiences to emphasize
- **Narrative Consistency**: Ensure consistent professional storytelling
